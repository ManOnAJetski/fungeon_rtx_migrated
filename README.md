## Description
A simple path tracer levereging Vulkan's cross platform ray tracing extensions.
This project is based of the excellent [Raytricing in a Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).
I created this mainly to practice CMake tooling and real time rendering with Vulkan

## Installation
The [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) must be installed.
Run `bootstrap.bat` which will initialise the vcpkg package manager locally in the repo which will pull other dependencies automatically
